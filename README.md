##1. Description:
Light and Shadow is an online, one player role-playing adventure game embodying an esoteric historical fiction / epic fantasy taking place in upstate New York, primarily in the Genesee Country of Western New York and around Greater Rochester. 

The game's narrative and many of the characters are fiction. The game incorporates non-fictional characters, such as Ebenezer Allan, Charles Carroll, William Fitzhugh, and Nathanial Rochester, the founders of Rochester, NY, as well as the Publick Universal Friend, Cornplanter, and the Fox Sisters.

The game incorporates non-fictional locations and historical elements, such as the Seneca Nation, the Society of Friends and New Jerusalem, and the Spiritualist movement that began around Rochester, NY.

Gameplay includes class text-adventure navigation, turned-based battles (in the mode of Final Fantasy), character interaction, and magic.
